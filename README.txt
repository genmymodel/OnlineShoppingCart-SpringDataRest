
                          Spring Rest Data application by GenMyModel

  What is it?
  ------------------------------------

  This is a Java Rest application relying on Spring Rest Data. It aims at helping developers
  to bootstrap a CRUD application. It has been generated by GenMyModel from a 
  class model. All the code is highly customizable.


  What can you do with this code ?
  ------------------------------------
 
  Anything you want. It can be run as it is for your private purpose or it can
  be a starting point to develop another web application.
  
  
  Launch the application
  ------------------------------------

  The easiest way is to use Maven. From the root directory, run "mvn jetty:run"
  and connect to http://localhost:9090. You can also import the content in 
  your favorite IDE to start a web project. 
 
 
  Data storage
  ------------------------------------
  
  Notice that the data won't be stored when the application stops or restarts, neither
  on your file-system nor in a database. It uses a H2 in-memory database.
  To use PotsgreSQL for example, refer to the class InfrastructureContextConfiguration
  and its method dataSource(), a commented example is provided.


  Can GenMyModel generate more ?
  ------------------------------------
  
  Yes! In fact, this is an experimental generator.
